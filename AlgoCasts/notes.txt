NOTES FROM COURSE

- whenever possible, avoid the old for loop syntax and use ES6 for...of

- put debugger; before statements but MUST be called after
  function etc() {
    debugger;
    ...code;
  }
  etc(value);

    cd exercisedirectory
    node inspect index.js
    type c to continue--executes code one line at a time
    repl to enter REPL shell (Read Evaluate Print Loop)
    type in variable names or code to evaluate
    remove statement + manual fx call once done

    can be put inside a for loop and will be called every time; must exit repl to use continue

DOC TIPS

- array.reduce((previous, element) => {
  statement;
}, initialValue);     creates single value out of array

- array.every((element, index) => {}) tests whether every element passes test fx; boolean result
