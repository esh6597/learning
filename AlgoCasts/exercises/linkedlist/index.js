// --- Directions
// Implement classes Node and Linked Lists
// See 'directions' document

// THIS IS A VERY COMMON INTERVIEW CONCEPT.
/**
 * - A chain of nodes where each node is linked to the next
 * - order is always maintained (unless we want to)
 * - HEAD: 1st node
 * - TAIL: last node: can be ID'd by its lack of link
 * - NODE: unit
 * - DATA + REFERENCE TO NEXT NODE: makes up a node
 * - Data can be an array or anything
 * - REFERENCE: node1 {} can be linked via: node1.next = node2;
